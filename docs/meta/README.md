## What's Here

### [Dedication](DEDICATION.md)
**5 minutes** | Alan Turing dedication

A dedication to Alan Turing, whose work on morphogenesis inspires SIL's approach to semantic structure and computation.

---

## Why This Exists

**Intellectual Lineage:**
SIL acknowledges its debt to Alan Turing's pioneering work on computation and pattern formation. The dedication establishes this connection.

**Context:**
Understanding SIL's philosophical foundations helps interpret the technical work.

## The Turing Connection

Why does SIL dedicate itself to Alan Turing?

**Short answer:** Turing's 1952 morphogenesis paper ("The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis") showed how simple rules + local interactions → complex global patterns. This parallels SIL's approach: simple semantic primitives + composition rules → rich knowledge structures.
