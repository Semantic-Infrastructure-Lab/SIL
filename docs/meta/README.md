# Meta Documentation

**Process, background, and documentation about documentation**

This directory contains meta-level information: how SIL documents were created, extraction processes, background context, and the history of the documentation itself.

## What's Here

### [Consolidation Summary](CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md)
**5 minutes** | How canonical docs were consolidated into the official repo

Chronicle of the November 2025 documentation consolidation:
- 20 documents from 3 sources (ChatGPT, Claude, big.md conversations)
- Migration from TIA workspace to official SIL repo
- Organization into current structure

**Useful for:** Understanding documentation provenance and history.

---

### [Dedication](DEDICATION.md)
**5 minutes** | Alan Turing dedication

A dedication to Alan Turing, whose work on morphogenesis inspires SIL's approach to semantic structure and computation.

**See also:** [Extended Turing Dedication](TURING_DEDICATION_EXTENDED.md) for deeper exploration of the morphogenesis connection.

---

### [Founder Background](FOUNDER_BACKGROUND.md)
**10 minutes** | Context and background for Scott Senkeresty

Extended background beyond the [Founder Profile](../canonical/FOUNDER_PROFILE.md):
- Technical background and experience
- Philosophical influences
- Why SIL, why now
- Personal context

---

### [Turing Dedication Extended](TURING_DEDICATION_EXTENDED.md)
**20 minutes** | The morphogenesis connection

Extended essay on Alan Turing's morphogenesis work and its connection to SIL's semantic infrastructure:
- Pattern formation in nature
- Computation and biological organization
- Why "Morphogen" is named for Turing's reaction-diffusion equations
- Deeper philosophical parallels

---

### [Doc Consolidation Plan](DOC_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md)
**5 minutes** | Technical plan for documentation consolidation

The technical plan that guided the November 2025 documentation reorganization:
- Source inventory
- Target structure
- Migration strategy
- Validation checklist

---

## Why Meta Docs Exist

**Transparency:**
These documents show where SIL's documentation came from, how it evolved, and what processes generated it.

**Provenance:**
Just as SIL values provenance in computation, we value it in documentation. You can trace how ideas emerged and were refined.

**Context:**
Understanding the background helps interpret the content. These docs provide that context.

## Document Provenance

All SIL canonical docs came from three sources:

**Source 1: ChatGPT Conversation (2025-11-25)**
- 78 messages
- Produced 9 foundational documents
- Session: glowing-matter-1125

**Source 2: Claude Conversation (2025-11-29)**
- 14,484 lines
- Produced 8 organizational/philosophical documents
- Session: roaring-squall-1129

**Source 3: big.md Strategic Conversation (2025-11-29)**
- 27,806 lines, ~100 turns
- Produced 7 strategy/positioning documents
- Sessions: golden-spark-1129 (analysis), citrine-shade-1129 (creation)

**Total:** 20 documents consolidated into official SIL repo (citrine-shade-1129, 2025-11-29)

See [Consolidation Summary](CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md) for complete details.

## The Turing Connection

Why do multiple meta docs reference Alan Turing?

**Short answer:** Turing's 1952 morphogenesis paper ("The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis") showed how simple rules + local interactions → complex global patterns. This parallels SIL's approach: simple semantic primitives + composition rules → rich knowledge structures.
