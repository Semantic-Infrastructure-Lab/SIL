# Scott A. Senkeresty

**Founder, Semantic Infrastructure Lab**

Scott Senkeresty founded SIL to build semantic substrate for AI—infrastructure where representations are explicit, transformations are traceable, and reasoning paths can be inspected and composed with human judgment.

## Background

Systems architect and infrastructure builder with four decades of experience across distributed systems, business intelligence, and semantic infrastructure. The work has always focused on building substrate that enables others.

**Education:** Computer Science, University of Colorado Boulder (1998-2001)
**SIL Founded:** 2023

## Career Arc

**Microsoft Research & Engineering (1994-2010)** — 16 years on distributed systems and high-stakes engineering:
- Distributed Systems Research (2001-2003): Peer-to-peer infrastructure with cryptographic identity, before Bitcoin
- Release engineering on systems serving hundreds of millions of devices
- Built analysis tools that let researchers inspect complex systems safely

**Business Intelligence Era (2010s)** — Consulting (Tiny Lizard). Helped dozens of organizations transform data into actionable insights. 50+ educational posts. Active community contributor.

**Semantic OS Era (2020s)** — Founded SIL. Designed 7-layer Semantic Operating System. Built production tools: Reveal, Morphogen, GenesisGraph, TiaCAD.

The pattern: Infrastructure thinking across evolving landscapes. Build substrate, not applications. Enable others.

## What's Been Built

### Production Systems
| System | Version | Tests | Status |
|--------|---------|-------|--------|
| **Reveal** | v0.18.0 | 103 | Production, PyPI |
| **Morphogen** | v0.11.0 | 900+ | Production |
| **GenesisGraph** | v0.3.0 | 363 | Production |
| **TiaCAD** | v3.1.2 | 1080+ | Production |

### Research Infrastructure
- **TIA** — Development environment where SIL is built. 14,549 files, 60 projects.
- **Beth** — Knowledge substrate. <400ms semantic search, 1,402 topics.

### Active Development
- RiffStack, SUP, BrowserBridge (Alpha/MVP)
- Pantheon, Agent Ether, Philbrick, Prism (Design phase)

## Philosophy

**Clarity Over Cleverness** — Write code that teaches itself. Structure before optimization.

**Infrastructure Over Applications** — Build substrate that enables others. Long-lived artifacts.

**Openness by Default** — MIT/Apache licenses. Public documentation.

**Evidence-First** — Show what's built, not vision. Measured results before philosophy.

**Humility & Provenance** — Work over person. Honor lineage.

### The Continuation

Scott didn't invent these values. He continues a tradition: Turing, K&R + UNIX, Jeremy Howard, 3Blue1Brown, and every teacher who wrote knowledge down.

## Working Methods

Scott works with **Tia**, SIL's Chief Semantic Agent—a transparent, named agent contributing decomposition, pattern discovery, and structural scaffolding. This collaboration demonstrates how transparent agents extend human reasoning when the system reveals every step.

## Current State (December 2025)

- **GitHub:** [Semantic-Infrastructure-Lab](https://github.com/Semantic-Infrastructure-Lab) (13 repositories)
- **Website:** [semanticinfrastructurelab.org](https://semanticinfrastructurelab.org)
- **Production:** 4 shipped, 3 MVP/Alpha, 4 design-phase systems

## Why SIL

AI requires **semantic infrastructure**—substrate where representations are explicit, transformations are traceable, and reasoning paths can be inspected and composed with human judgment.

SIL builds this: persistent semantic memory, unified intermediate representations, deterministic engines, multi-agent orchestration, and interfaces where every cognitive layer remains visible.

The work is difficult, long-term, and necessary.
