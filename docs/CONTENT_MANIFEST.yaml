# SIL Documentation Content Manifest
# ==================================================
#
# PURPOSE: Glass-box transparency for documentation visibility
#
# PRINCIPLES:
#   • Explicit over implicit: Every file categorized as public or internal
#   • Rationale required: Document WHY each decision was made
#   • Flat structure: Simple, easy to parse, hard to break
#   • Version controlled: This file is public, demonstrating transparency
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/sync-docs.py              # Sync only visibility: public files
#   ./scripts/sync-docs.py --validate   # Check for internal files in website
#   ./scripts/sync-docs.py --clean      # Remove internal files from website

# ==================================================
# KEY DECISIONS
# ==================================================

decisions:
  - date: 2025-12-16
    session: chrome-hue-1216
    decision: Do not sync DEDICATION.md to public website
    reason: "Contains 'SIL ❤️ Alan' and 'this lab exists in recognition of that loss' language that contradicts tone calibration work"
    alternatives: [Rewrite with humble tone, Remove entirely, Move to INFLUENCES_AND_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md]
    chosen: Keep internal until removal decision made
    recommendation: Remove entirely

  - date: 2025-12-16
    session: chrome-hue-1216
    decision: Keep operational docs internal
    reason: "MARKDOWN_STYLE_GUIDE, SIL_TOOL_QUALITY_MONITORING are process documentation, not public content"
    impact: Prevents operational details from cluttering public documentation

  - date: 2025-12-16
    session: bronze-spark-1216
    decision: Use CONTENT_MANIFEST.yaml not .content-manifest.yaml
    reason: Glass-box transparency - visible over hidden, no dotfiles
    philosophy: SIL doesn't hide decisions in dotfiles

  - date: 2025-12-16
    session: bronze-spark-1216
    decision: Use flat YAML structure instead of nested
    reason: Simpler to write, parse, and validate. Fewer YAML syntax errors.
    impact: 2 levels max instead of 4+ levels of nesting

# ==================================================
# SYNC CONFIGURATION
# ==================================================

sync:
  policy: allowlist
  description: Only files with visibility public are synced to website
  script: scripts/sync-docs.py

  source: /home/scottsen/src/projects/SIL/docs/
  target: /home/scottsen/src/projects/sil-website/docs/
  website: https://semanticinfrastructurelab.org

validation:
  pre_sync:
    - Verify all public files exist at source
    - Check for broken links in public content
    - Validate no files flagged_for_removal are synced

  post_sync:
    - Verify all public files copied to website
    - Validate no internal files in website repo
    - Check no visibility internal files accessible via web

  continuous:
    - Check on every sync for internal files in website
    - Check on commit that new files have visibility assigned
    - Check weekly that manifest matches filesystem reality

# NOTES
# ==================================================

notes:
  philosophy: |
    This manifest embodies glass-box transparency. We explicitly document
    what's internal vs public with rationale. The manifest itself is public,
    demonstrating commitment to transparent operations.

  maintenance: |
    When adding new files to docs/, update this manifest with visibility
    and rationale. Default to internal until reviewed for publication.

    See docs/operations/CONTENT_MANIFEST_GUIDE.md for complete workflows.

  flat_structure: |
    This manifest uses a flat structure (2 levels max) to avoid YAML
    complexity. All file metadata is in flat fields, not nested objects.
    This makes it easier to write, read, parse, and validate.

  documentation: |
    Complete documentation for this system:

    - CONTENT_MANIFEST_GUIDE.md (full guide, 600+ lines)
    - CONTENT_MANIFEST_QUICK_REF.md (one-page cheat sheet)
    - WEBSITE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md (deployment workflows)
    - README_SYNCED_CONTENT.md (website repo sync docs)

    All in docs/operations/ directory.
