## Overview

The Semantic Infrastructure Lab requires a founding team that embodies **both deep technical expertise and civilizational vision**. This document describes eight archetypes—not job descriptions, but **archetypal energies**—needed to launch and sustain the lab.

These archetypes emerged from analyzing what's required to build semantic infrastructure that serves civilization, not just academic research or commercial products.

## The Eight Founding Archetypes

### 1. The Systems Titan

**Core Energy:** *"I build infrastructure that outlasts me."*

**Description:**
The Systems Titan is the principal architect who can see—and build—the entire semantic stack from first principles. They think in layers, abstractions, and long time horizons. They have built large-scale systems before and know the difference between a demo and a foundation.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Systems Thinking** - Sees the forest and the trees simultaneously
- **Long-Term Vision** - Builds for decades, not quarters
- **Technical Depth** - Can implement, not just design
- **Architectural Taste** - Knows when to abstract and when to stay concrete
- **Principled Pragmatism** - Willing to ship imperfect v1 if it unblocks progress

**Typical Background:**
- Lead architect on major open-source infrastructure (databases, compilers, operating systems)
- 15+ years of systems programming experience
- Published research in programming languages, distributed systems, or formal methods
- Reputation for "built things that are still running 10 years later"

**At SIL, they:**
- Design the Semantic OS architecture
- Lead the Morphogen deterministic computation platform
- Set technical standards and review critical architectural decisions
- Mentor junior systems engineers
- Write the canonical reference implementations

**Warning Signs of a Pseudo-Titan:**
- Only designs, never implements
- Constantly rewrites foundations instead of building upward
- Dismisses "application work" as beneath them
- Can't explain complex systems simply

**Example Profiles:**
- Someone who contributed to Linux kernel or built a database engine
- Former Google/Meta infrastructure lead who wants research freedom
- PL researcher who wants to see their ideas used in the real world

### 2. The Integrator

**Core Energy:** *"I make incompatible things work together."*

**Description:**
The Integrator excels at bridging domains, translating between paradigms, and making systems interoperate. They are polyglots—comfortable in multiple programming languages, research traditions, and modes of thinking. Where the Titan builds vertically, the Integrator connects horizontally.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Polyglot Mastery** - Fluent in 5+ programming languages and paradigms
- **Translation Skills** - Can explain functional programming to imperative programmers
- **Pattern Recognition** - Sees isomorphisms across different domains
- **Pragmatic Eclecticism** - Uses the best tool for the job, no religious wars
- **Empathy for Context** - Understands why different domains evolved different approaches

**Typical Background:**
- Built integrations between major systems (API design, data pipelines, cross-platform tools)
- Contributed to polyglot projects (Jupyter, Babel, LLVM)
- Experience in multiple paradigms (OOP, FP, logic programming, dataflow)
- Reputation for "the person who made X and Y finally talk to each other"

**At SIL, they:**
- Design Pantheon IR (the universal intermediate representation)
- Build bridges between domain-specific modules
- Lead integration sprints across SIL-Core and SIL-Civilization
- Ensure different teams can share semantic representations
- Write adapters, translators, and protocol converters

**Warning Signs of a Pseudo-Integrator:**
- Creates overly complex abstraction layers
- Prioritizes elegance over practical interoperability
- Builds integration frameworks no one uses
- Can't ship because they're still adding "one more adapter"

**Example Profiles:**
- Senior engineer who integrated ML systems with traditional databases
- Open-source contributor to major polyglot toolchains
- Consultant who specialized in "impossible integrations"

---

### 3. The Community Architect

**Core Energy:** *"I build cultures, not just code."*

## How the Archetypes Work Together

### Complementary Strengths

The eight archetypes form a balanced team:

```
Technical Depth              Human & Social Systems
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Systems Titan               Human Systems Steward
Integrator                  Ethical Systems Guardian
Scale Translator            Community Architect
                            Narrative Infrastructure Director
                            Built-World Architect
```

**No single person embodies all eight.** A strong founding team has 1-2 people strongly aligned with each archetype.

### Key Tensions (Healthy Ones)

**Systems Titan ↔ Human Systems Steward**
- Titan: "The abstraction is elegant."
- Steward: "But will users understand it?"
- Result: Powerful systems with humane interfaces

**Scale Translator ↔ Ethical Systems Guardian**
- Translator: "We need to ship and scale."
- Guardian: "We need to ensure this doesn't cause harm at scale."
- Result: Responsible rapid growth

**Community Architect ↔ Narrative Director**
- Architect: "We need inclusive, participatory processes."
- Director: "We need a clear, compelling message."
- Result: Welcoming community with strong identity

**Integrator ↔ Built-World Architect**
- Integrator: "Systems should compose seamlessly."
- Architect: "Spaces should foster serendipitous encounters."
- Result: Both technical and spatial infrastructure for collaboration

### Decision-Making Patterns

Different archetypes lead different decisions:

| Decision Type | Primary Archetype(s) |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Core technical architecture | Systems Titan + Integrator |
| Production deployment strategy | Scale Translator |
| Community governance model | Community Architect + Ethical Guardian |
| Public messaging | Narrative Director |
| User research methodology | Human Systems Steward |
| Physical space design | Built-World Architect |
| Open-source licensing | Ethical Guardian + Integrator |
| Hiring criteria | All archetypes (consensus) |

### Red Flags During Recruitment

Watch for:
- **Ego over mission** - "I want to be famous" vs "I want SIL to succeed"
- **Short-term thinking** - "What's the exit strategy?" (there isn't one; this is research infrastructure)
- **Domain chauvinism** - "My specialty is the only important thing"
- **Inability to collaborate** - Brilliant individual who can't work in teams
- **Ethics as theater** - Performative concern without practical commitment

### Green Flags During Recruitment

Look for:
- **Long-term commitment** - "I want to spend 5-10 years building this"
- **Intellectual humility** - "I don't know X, but I can learn"
- **Cross-domain curiosity** - Genuinely interested in areas outside their specialty
- **Builder's mindset** - "Let's ship something imperfect and iterate"
- **Stewardship orientation** - "How do we ensure this benefits everyone?"

## Evolution Over Time

### Initial Team (Year 1)

Start with 6-8 people covering all eight archetypes:
- 1 Systems Titan (leads SIL-Core)
- 1 Integrator (bridges divisions)
- 1 Community Architect (builds culture from day one)
- 1 Human Systems Steward (ensures user-centered approach)
- 1 Scale Translator (plans for production from the start)
- 1 Narrative Director (articulates vision)
- 1 Built-World Architect (designs the space)
- 1 Ethical Guardian (embedded from founding)

Some people may embody multiple archetypes (especially early on).

### Growth Phase (Years 2-5)

Expand to 30-50 people:
- Each archetype attracts 3-5 aligned researchers
- Specialization emerges within archetypes
- Clear division between SIL-Core and SIL-Civilization teams
- External collaborators and visiting researchers

### Maturity (Years 5-10)

50-100 people:
- Well-established culture based on founding archetypes
- New archetypes may emerge based on lab's evolution
- Multiple generations of researchers mentored in this model
- The archetypes become "SIL DNA" that new members internalize

---

## Conclusion

These eight archetypes are not job descriptions—they are **energies and orientations** that a healthy SIL founding team embodies. No single person perfectly fits one archetype, and some exceptional individuals may embody two or three.

The goal is not to hire "one of each" mechanically, but to ensure the founding team collectively possesses:
- Deep technical capability (Titan, Integrator, Translator)
- Human and ethical grounding (Steward, Guardian)
- Community and narrative strength (Architect, Director)
- Physical infrastructure vision (Built-World Architect)

When these eight energies are present and balanced, SIL will have the **cultural DNA** to build semantic infrastructure that truly serves civilization.
