# **Founder Background**

**Scott A. Senkeresty**
*Founder & Chief Semantic Architect, Semantic Infrastructure Lab*

Scott Senkeresty is a systems-oriented builder with over four decades of experience designing, analyzing, and maintaining complex software infrastructure. His work has consistently focused on making complexity inspectable—whether in distributed systems, data modeling, security tooling, or semantic reasoning. SIL is a continuation of that lifetime of work: an effort to build the semantic foundations intelligent systems require.

Scott published his first technical work at age 13 in *Compute! Gazette* (1984), explaining multicolor sprite techniques for the Commodore 64. Even then, his instinct was to illuminate mechanisms so others could build more effectively. That pattern continued throughout his career.

He spent 16 years at Microsoft working across distributed systems, security infrastructure, and automation tooling. As part of the Windows networking group, he contributed to the development of early peer-to-peer and identity technologies during the era that produced the Peer Name Resolution Protocol. His work helped create tooling and simplified APIs that made these systems accessible to non-specialists.

He later joined Microsoft's anti-malware team, supporting one of the most high-stakes release pipelines in the industry. He built automation and inspection tools used by malware researchers to safely analyze encrypted and obfuscated threats. In this environment, transparency, reliability, and careful systems thinking were not academic goals—they were operational necessities.

Scott also worked on tooling for Office setup and for MSN engineering teams, creating diff-based inspection systems, automated testers, and profilers that helped developers understand complex build and runtime behavior. His work consistently focused on exposing internal structure and making hidden systems visible.

After leaving Microsoft, he founded Tiny Lizard, a consulting practice that helped dozens of organizations—from NASA JPL to manufacturing businesses to agricultural cooperatives—understand their data and build actionable analytical models. His writing on DAX and Power Pivot helped thousands of analysts develop clearer intuition for modeling and cohort-based reasoning.

SIL is the synthesis of these domains: distributed systems, transparent tooling, data modeling, and conceptual engineering. Scott's long-standing motivation is unchanged—to build infrastructure that helps people understand complex systems and act with clarity. The Semantic Operating System is his most ambitious expression of that principle: a substrate for interpretable machine cognition.

Scott works closely with Tia, SIL's Chief Semantic Agent, in an engineered human–agent reasoning loop that exemplifies the lab's commitment to transparency and semantic structure. This collaboration informs the lab's research direction and its development of the Semantic OS stack.

Across all eras of his career, Scott's work is animated by a simple, consistent belief: systems should reveal their structure. That belief now shapes the Semantic Infrastructure Lab and the future of transparent AI.
