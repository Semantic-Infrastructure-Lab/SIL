# Canonical Documents

**The foundational documents of the Semantic Infrastructure Lab**

These are the authoritative, definitive documents that define SIL's mission, principles, technical architecture, and research direction. If you're new to SIL, start here.

## Core Foundation (Required Reading)

### [Founder's Letter](FOUNDERS_LETTER.md) ⭐ Start Here
**10 minutes** | A personal introduction to SIL's mission and approach

The founder explains why SIL exists, what gap it fills in modern AI infrastructure, and the commitment to explicit meaning and provenance.

### [Manifesto](SIL_MANIFESTO.md)
**15 minutes** | Why semantic infrastructure matters

The problem with contemporary AI systems: they lack explicit meaning, stable memory, inspectable reasoning, and provenance. SIL exists to build this missing layer.

### [Principles](SIL_PRINCIPLES.md)
**10 minutes** | The 14 principles that guide all SIL work

- 5 design principles (Clarity, Simplicity, Composability, Correctness, Verifiability)
- 9 operational principles (Structure before heuristics, Meaning must be explicit, Provenance everywhere, etc.)

### [Technical Charter](SIL_TECHNICAL_CHARTER.md)
**45 minutes** | The formal specification

The complete 6-layer Semantic OS architecture, USIR specification, layer definitions, and system invariants. This is the "constitution" of SIL's technical architecture.

### [Glossary](SIL_GLOSSARY.md)
**20 minutes** | Canonical vocabulary (61 terms)

Precise definitions for all core concepts. Keep this open while reading other documents.

### [Research Agenda Year 1](SIL_RESEARCH_AGENDA_YEAR1.md)
**30 minutes** | Current research focus

The four research themes, milestones, deliverables, and success criteria for SIL's first year.

## Founding Team

### [Founder Profile](FOUNDER_PROFILE.md)
**5 minutes** | Scott A. Senkeresty

Background, experience, and approach to building SIL.

### [Tia Profile](TIA_PROFILE.md)
**5 minutes** | Chief Semantic Agent

About Tia, SIL's AI collaborator and co-architect.

## Extended Vision Documents

These documents provide deeper exploration of SIL's organizational structure, physical design, and philosophical foundations. They are not required reading but provide valuable context.

### [Two-Division Structure](SIL_TWO_DIVISION_STRUCTURE.md)
**20 minutes** | SIL-Core and SIL-Civilization

How SIL organizes into two complementary divisions: one building the semantic kernel, one building the civilization stack.

### [Founding Team Archetypes](SIL_FOUNDING_TEAM_ARCHETYPES.md)
**25 minutes** | Eight essential roles

Systems Titan, Integrator, Community Architect, Human Systems Steward, Ethical Guardian, Scale Translator, Narrative Director, Built-World Architect.

### [Physical Lab Design](SIL_PHYSICAL_LAB_DESIGN.md)
**25 minutes** | Five-zone building architecture

How physical space shapes intellectual possibility: Pupil, Corridors, Creative/Collaborative, Quiet Zone, Fire Ring.

### [Semantic OS Architecture](SIL_SEMANTIC_OS_ARCHITECTURE.md)
**30 minutes** | Six-layer technical deep dive

Detailed exploration of each layer in the Semantic Operating System.

### [Morphogen Project](SIL_MORPHOGEN_PROJECT.md)
**25 minutes** | Deterministic computation platform

Deep dive into Morphogen's architecture, philosophy, and role in the SIL ecosystem.

### [Stewardship Manifesto](SIL_STEWARDSHIP_MANIFESTO.md)
**20 minutes** | Values and governance

How SIL approaches stewardship, decision-making, and long-term sustainability.

### [Civilizational Systems Engineering](SIL_CIVILIZATIONAL_SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING.md)
**30 minutes** | Core conceptual framework

The philosophical and systems-thinking foundations underlying SIL's approach.
