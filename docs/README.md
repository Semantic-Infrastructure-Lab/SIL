## 💡 Tips

**1. Keep the Glossary open**
The [Glossary](canonical/SIL_GLOSSARY.md) defines canonical terms. Reference it while reading.

**2. Start with the Unified Architecture Guide**
The [Unified Architecture Guide](architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md) is the Rosetta Stone - it explains how everything connects.

**3. Try the tools**
Installing reveal and seeing progressive disclosure in action makes the philosophy concrete.

**4. Read in order**
Documents build on each other. Manifesto → Architecture → Deep dives.
