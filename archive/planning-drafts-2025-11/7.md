Based on the prototypes, repositories, and architectures you have shared, here is the catalog of tools **already developed** by the Semantic Infrastructure Lab (SIL).

These are not theoretical concepts; these are executing systems that solve specific structural failures in modern computing.

### 🏛️ Pillar 1: The Computational Substrate
*Tools that replace "black box" guessing with deterministic, reproducible calculation.*

#### **1. Morphogen**
* **What it is:** A deterministic, multi-domain simulation engine. It unifies physics, audio, geometry, circuits, and optimization into a single semantic execution kernel.
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For Scientists:** Allows cross-domain modeling (e.g., simulating a guitar string's vibration *and* its acoustic output *and* the room acoustics in one coherent pass).
    * **For AI Training:** Generates synthetic data where the ground truth is mathematically perfect, not estimated.
    * **For Reproducibility:** Ensures a simulation run today yields the *exact* bit-wise same result 10 years from now, regardless of hardware.

#### **2. Philbrick**
* **What it is:** A modular hybrid analog/digital computing platform. It serves as the hardware counterpart to Morphogen, using analog circuits for continuous-time dynamics and digital logic for control.
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For Ultra-Low Power Compute:** Performs continuous-time math (integration, summation) using a fraction of the energy of a GPU.
    * **For Robotics/Control:** Provides latency-free feedback loops for physical systems.

### 🔍 Pillar 2: Meaning & Structure
*Tools that make code and data understandable to agents without brute force.*

#### **3. Reveal**
* **What it is:** A progressive semantic explorer for codebases. Instead of forcing an LLM to read every file (expensive, slow), Reveal parses the structure locally and hands the agent *only* the relevant definitions and relationships.
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For Developer Agents:** Reduces the energy and cost of "reasoning about code" by **1,000x**.
    * **For Large Repos:** Allows agents to navigate massive codebases deterministically without getting lost in the noise of raw text.

#### **4. USIR (Universal Semantic Intermediate Representation)**
* **What it is:** The "Esperanto" of the Semantic OS. A typed, graph-structured language that allows different tools (CAD, Math, Physics, Code) to share data without losing meaning.
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For Tool Chaining:** Allows a CAD tool to send a geometry to a physics simulator without breaking the definition of "stress" or "material."

### 🔗 Pillar 3: Trust & Provenance
*Tools that ensure we know where information came from.*

#### **5. GenesisGraph**
* **What it is:** A universal standard for provenance. It records the lineage of every digital artifact—who created it, what tools were used, and what data was ingested—cryptographically committed to a graph.
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For AI Auditability:** Proves that an image or summary was generated by a specific model using specific trusted sources.
    * **For Supply Chain:** Tracks the "bill of materials" for data and software, ensuring no poisoned models enter the pipeline.

### 🤖 Pillar 4: Agency & Orchestration
*Tools that stop AI agents from acting like chaotic hallucinations.*

#### **6. Agent Ether**
* **What it is:** The "TCP/IP" for AI tools. It defines a standard contract (TBC) for how agents discover, permission, and invoke tools.
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For Safety:** Prevents agents from blindly executing dangerous commands (like `rm -rf`) by enforcing permission scopes.
    * **For Multi-Agent Systems:** Allows Agent A to use Agent B's tools without needing custom integration code.

#### **7. Groqqy**
* **What it is:** A minimal "kernel" for persistent AI agents. It combines an LLM with semantic memory (vector search) and a self-improvement loop.
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For Personal Intelligence:** Acts as a "second brain" that remembers every conversation, searches past context, and refines its own answers over weeks, not just minutes.
    * **The Warning:** It demonstrates that AGI-like behavior is already possible with current models if given the right memory architecture.

### 🎨 Pillar 5: Interface & Design
*Tools that bridge human intent and machine execution.*

#### **8. SUP (Semantic UI Platform)**
* **What it is:** A semantic engine for user interfaces. It defines UI by *intent* (e.g., "Login Flow") rather than pixel placement, and compiles it into any framework (React, Vue, Native).
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For Generative UI:** Allows AI to build perfect, accessible interfaces instantly without writing brittle HTML/CSS.
    * **For Design Systems:** Enforces brand and accessibility rules mathematically across an entire organization.

#### **9. TiaCAD**
* **What it is:** A declarative, parametric CAD engine. It defines physical objects using code and logic (YAML) rather than mouse clicks.
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For Manufacturing:** Allows hardware designs to be version-controlled, diffed, and refactored just like software.
    * **For AI Design:** Enables agents to design physical parts by writing structured code, which is far more reliable than generating 3D meshes.

#### **10. RiffStack**
* **What it is:** A real-time semantic performance environment. It treats code, sound, and logic as a live, improvisational medium.
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For Human-AI Jamming:** Allows humans to "play" semantic systems like an instrument, exploring the latent space of models in real-time.

### 🧪 Pillar 6: Analytics & Data
*The missing analytical substrate.*

#### **11. Prism (Set Stack)**
* **What it is:** An analytical engine built on MLIR. It provides a semantic layer for relational data, queries, and optimization.
* **Usefulness Today:**
    * **For Data Science:** Unifies SQL-like querying with semantic reasoning, allowing complex data workflows to be optimized and executed transparently.
