# Vision Documents

**Long-term aspirations and philosophical foundations**

These documents explore SIL's broader vision: what the world looks like if we succeed, how systems thinking shapes our approach, and the deeper philosophical commitments underlying our technical choices.

## Core Vision

### [SIL Vision Complete](SIL_VISION_COMPLETE.md)
**15 minutes** | What success looks like

The complete founding vision for the Semantic Infrastructure Lab:
- The world in 10-20 years if semantic infrastructure becomes standard
- How intelligent systems evolve beyond statistical pattern matching
- The role of explicit meaning, provenance, and structure
- SIL's place in the broader AI ecosystem

**This is aspirational, not technical.** It explains the long game.

## Integration Visions

### [Reveal SIL Integration](REVEAL_SIL_INTEGRATION.md)
**10 minutes** | How progressive disclosure fits the Semantic OS

How `reveal` (the code exploration tool) embodies SIL principles and integrates with the broader semantic infrastructure:
- Progressive disclosure as Layer 5 interface pattern
- Structure before detail (the SIL way)
- Connection to USIR browsing
- Future: Semantic code graphs

**Why this matters:** Shows how even small tools reflect the larger vision.

## Future Vision Documents (Candidates)

These documents exist in `../canonical/` but might belong here as "vision" rather than "canonical foundation":

### [SIL Two-Division Structure](../canonical/SIL_TWO_DIVISION_STRUCTURE.md)
Organizational vision: SIL-Core builds the kernel, SIL-Civilization builds applications.

### [SIL Physical Lab Design](../canonical/SIL_PHYSICAL_LAB_DESIGN.md)
Physical space vision: Five zones supporting different cognitive modes.

### [SIL Founding Team Archetypes](../canonical/SIL_FOUNDING_TEAM_ARCHETYPES.md)
Team vision: Eight archetypal energies for balanced research organization.

### [SIL Stewardship Manifesto](../canonical/SIL_STEWARDSHIP_MANIFESTO.md)
Governance vision: Long-term values and decision-making principles.

### [SIL Civilizational Systems Engineering](../canonical/SIL_CIVILIZATIONAL_SYSTEMS_ENGINEERING.md)
Philosophical vision: Core conceptual framework for systems thinking.

**Note:** These might be reorganized into this directory in the future to keep `canonical/` focused on technical foundations.

## What Makes a Vision Document?

Vision documents share these characteristics:

**Aspirational time horizon:**
- 5-20 year outlook
- What becomes possible, not what exists now
- Broader societal/technical impact

**Philosophical foundations:**
- Why we make certain design choices
- Values that guide technical decisions
- Long-term commitments

**Inspirational, not prescriptive:**
- Motivates the work
- Explains the "why"
- Provides north star

**Contrasts with:**
- Technical specs (canonical/)
- How-to guides (guides/)
- Architecture patterns (architecture/)
- Research papers (research/)

## The Vision in One Paragraph

SIL envisions a future where intelligent systems are built on **explicit semantic infrastructure**—not just statistical patterns, but structured meaning with clear provenance, inspectable reasoning, and verifiable transformations. Just as operating systems provide memory, processes, and files for computation, the Semantic OS provides semantic memory, universal representations, and deterministic execution for knowledge work. This isn't AI replacing humans; it's infrastructure that makes human-AI collaboration reliable, transparent, and grounded in meaning rather than heuristics.

- Why 6-layer architecture → [Technical Charter](../canonical/SIL_TECHNICAL_CHARTER.md)
- Why these principles → [Principles](../canonical/SIL_PRINCIPLES.md)

**Architecture documents explain the "how":**
- How the pattern works → [Unified Architecture Guide](../architecture/UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE_GUIDE.md)
- How to design well → [Design Principles](../architecture/DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md)

**Research documents explain the "what's hard":**
- What problems we're solving → [Research Papers](../research/)
- What questions remain open → [Research Agenda](../canonical/SIL_RESEARCH_AGENDA_YEAR1.md)
